# Churn Prediction Model

## Project Overview

Analyzing IBM sales data to identify areas with the highest sales churn and to determine which services are most prone to churn and impact sales. By implementing a machine learning model, we aim to provide insights and predictions to help mitigate churn and improve sales strategies.

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis**: Analyzed IBM sales data to identify areas with the highest sales churn.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Implemented a predictive model to determine the likelihood of churn.
- **Findings**: The most significant churn impact in sales was identified with customers using multiple phone lines.
- **Model Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy of 81% with the predictive model.

## Languages and Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Seaborn**
